Answer the following question in a JavaScript file named `hw_1-2.js`. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write the program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


In an untitled RPG, there are 3 different classes to choose from: warrior, ranger, and mage. 

* Warriors have twice as much defense, but have a -2 penalty on their attack.
* Rangers have a -1 penalty to their defense, but do three times as much damage per attack.
* Mages' defense is determined by dividing their defense by how many enemies they are fighting, and their attack is exponential based on how many enemies they are fighting.

Create a program that will calculate the attack and defense of each of these classes. Your program should display the attack and defense of each class when the program runs the following statement: `The warrior's attack is :## and his defense is :##.` Where the `##` is replaced by the correct value for that attribute.

To test the program, assume the base attack and defense are 20 and the mage is fighting 3 enemies. You can change these values to see how the program responds.
